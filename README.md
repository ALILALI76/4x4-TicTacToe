**How the game works:**

Symbols 'X' and 'O' are alternately placed in squares 1-16 until there are three of the same symbols next to each other 
either vertically, horizontally or diagonally in which case the symbol looses or until all 16 squares are occupied which results in a draw.
Symbols are placed by typing in the number of the desired square into the console and confirmed by pressing the enter button.
You play with 2 players and you may choose who starts the game as 'X'.

**Special to the HTML version:**

A start-button to start the game.
Differently colored 'X' and 'O'.
If three same symbols are placed next to each other the game highlights those to make them easily visible.
GameOver-Overlay which you can click on to restart the game.
